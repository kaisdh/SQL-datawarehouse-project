Data Warehouse & Analytics  Project
Welcome to my Data Warehouse & Analytics  project! 🚀
This project showcases my skills in building a data warehouse and delivering insights using MySQL and data engineering practices.

📖 Project Overview
In this project, I built a data warehouse that includes:

Data Architecture: Using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data into the warehouse.
Data Modeling: Creating tables optimized for analysis.
Analytics & Reporting: Building MySQL-based reports and dashboards for business insights.
🛠️ Tools & Resources
Datasets: Raw data (CSV files) used in the project.
MySQL: Database management system for storing and querying data.
MySQL Workbench: Tool for managing MySQL databases.
GitHub: Code version control and management.
DrawIO: Tool for architecture and flow diagrams.
Notion: Project management tool.
🚀 Project Scope
Data Engineering: Building the Data Warehouse
Objective:
Build a data warehouse with MySQL, consolidating sales and customer data for reporting.

Specifications:

Data Sources: ERP and CRM systems (CSV format).
Data Quality: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
Integration: Combine both sources into one unified data model.
Data Analytics: Insights & Reporting
Objective:
Create MySQL queries and reports on:

Customer Behavior
Product Performance
Sales Trends
These insights help make data-driven decisions.

🏗️ Data Architecture
The project follows Medallion Architecture:

Bronze Layer: Raw data from source systems.
Silver Layer: Cleansed and transformed data.
Gold Layer: Analytical data for reporting.
